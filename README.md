# Weather Dashboard

Use the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities.

## Project Notes

The application defaults to main Australian cities after opening or refreshing the application. The default city displayed is Melbourne.

The UV index value color assignment could be found on the the following link: (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet).

I also add a messaging to indicate that an invalid city is selected using ajaxError and ajaxSuccess event handlers.
